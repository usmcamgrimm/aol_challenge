# Take Home Code Challenge

# Description

We are going to build backend tooling for a publicly available Geo resolution API, [GeoJS](https://www.geojs.io/docs/v1/endpoints/geo/). We will use this API to retrieve the country and city associated with any IP address.

We are looking for the following

- Design choices
- Coding style, quality, and readability
- Testing
- Documentation around design trade-offs you made, or any other considerations you want to call out (inside README)
- Bonus: Edge cases and completeness

This should take you between 2-4 hours. When you are done, push your solution to a **private Github repository** and add these people as contributors (to view):

1. toyhammered
2. dpaola2

# The Challenge

Build a REST API using Ruby on Rails 7 that allows users to submit IP addresses. 

1. Fetch the country & city from GeoJS and store the results.
2. A second end point should allow users to see all previously queried IP addresses alongside relevant data. 
3. The user should also be able to filter these IP addresses by country & city. Each API should return JSON.
4. In the README, please include your thought process and explain why you made the decisions you did (this should include edge cases, even if you were not able to implement them). This is extremely important.

## AI Usage

Feel free to use whatever resources available, but all work should be done by you. ChatGPT is a great tool, but it is still important you understand the code you write.

# Submitting Code
